initializing table with all 1-char strings?
	set int to 0-255? no

code.c is for sending (encode) and receiving (decode)


why getchar() returns int:
	needs a way to signal special character (e.g. EOF)

Questions to ponder:
-new assignment of codes after prunes has to be same in encode (new trie) and decode (new array)
	-use combined array/trie structure

array has pointers to nodes
nodes have codes===indices of array
when adding string to trie, put new pointer in array to that node
pruning trie:
	find root of subtrie that needs to be pruned
	recursively free/set array pointer to NULL
	make new array by putting non-NULL pointers in contiguously
	(if you want to keep the 1-char strings, check trie depth)

Compression algo with trie methods:

Trie t = top of the trie

C = t
While ((K = getchar()) != EOF)
	Trie currT = getT(C,K);
	if (currT != NULL && hasCode(currT))
		
		C = currT
	else
		putBit(getCode(C))
